# DE-Exercises Repository

Welcome to the **DE-Exercises** repository! This repository serves as a personal space for learning, practicing, and refining Data Engineering skills. It is a collection of exercises, projects, and analyses that I am working on to build a strong foundation in Data Engineering concepts, tools, and best practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into various folders, each representing a different project or exercise. Below is an overview of the current structure:

### 1. **Titanic**
   - **Description**: This folder contains my analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on data cleaning and preprocessing using the Pandas library. The work includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, feature scaling, and other essential data manipulation techniques.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## Objectives

This repository aims to:
- **Learn and Apply**: Serve as a practical workspace to apply Data Engineering concepts through hands-on exercises.
- **Document Progress**: Track progress and document learnings in each project or exercise.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide examples and code snippets that can be useful for others who are learning Data Engineering.

## Technologies and Tools

The following technologies and tools are commonly used in the exercises and projects within this repository:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
- **SQL**: For database interactions and data querying.
- **Apache Spark**: For big data processing.
- **Docker**: For containerization and environment management.
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: For cloud computing and data engineering tasks.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the folders and files to see the various exercises and projects. Each folder typically contains:
- **Code**: Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or SQL files with the code for the exercise or project.
- **Data**: Any datasets used in the project, if not too large, or instructions on how to download the data.
- **Documentation**: Markdown files or comments in the code that explain the approach, methods used, and key learnings.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises or projects:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/myujjawal/DE-Exercises.git
    cd DE-Exercises
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to a Specific Folder**:
    ```bash
    cd Titanic
    ```

3. **Run the Code**: Follow instructions in the README files within each folder to run the code and replicate the analysis.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow in the field of Data Engineering, this repository will be updated with new exercises, projects, and possibly even contributions from others. Some future topics and areas of exploration may include:
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Exploring complex querying techniques.
- **Big Data Technologies**: Working with Hadoop, Spark, and related tools.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Building and automating ETL processes.
- **Data Warehousing**: Exploring concepts and tools for data warehousing.

## Contributions

While this is a personal learning repository, I welcome contributions, suggestions, or discussions on the exercises and projects. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have improvements or ideas to share.
